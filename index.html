                <p>I work with veterans and their families, mostly retired. Many of them are disabled physically or are
                    suffering from PTSD. At first, it was difficult for me to emphathize with my clients. They were
                    abrupt, tempermental and, quite often, judgemental. Hearing their stories can be depressing at
                    times, also.
                    So many of them, all equally angry, unhappy and border-line poverty, I dared to speak out, but
                    always wanted to ask,
                    "why did you (choose this path)?"
                </p>
                <p id="paragraph2">One weekend morning, I had a privilige to
                    speak with an elderly veteran, who has experienced it all - deployments, wars, losses and victories
                    -
                    thoughout his career as an active-duty and a reservist. "Had I known it better," he said. He also
                    said, "no, no regrets. But, have we all known better. Consider it was the
                    result of the fear of uncertainty." </p>
                <p>They were young, uncertain and, maybe, needed a sence of uniformity. Yes, they all had a piece of
                    patriotism in them.
                    No doubt. However, it was that uncertainty that gave them a counrage to leave their motherland and
                    fight for that intangible 'ism'.
                    I still cringe speaking to veterans who start and end with self-pity grumpiness. However, I now
                    know that they, too, just like the
                    other elderly veteran, made most out of their uncertainties, and envisioned something different,
                    something better.
